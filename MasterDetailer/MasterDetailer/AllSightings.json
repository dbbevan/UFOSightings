In the sky, in my line of sight, I saw a bright spherical shapped object which was moving slowly to the SW. The ufo moved from straight above my position to a point about 35 degrees above the SW horizon, where it stopped. It remained stationary for about 30 seconds, then it began to move slowly towards the NW. As this ufo moved back towards my position, I noticed a second ufo of the same shape, size, and color and traveling on the same trajectory as the first ufo. The first ufo was beginning to dim as it moved to the NW. The ufo on the SW course remained bright. The two ufo&apos;s passed each other moving in opposite directions. As I was looking at the second ufo, I lost track of the first one. The second ufo also stopped in the same manner as the first, and then it also proceeded on a NW track. As the second ufo traveled NW, it too began to fade as though it were gaining altitude. I watched this ufo until it finally faded out. Both of these ufo&apos;s traveled on an identical triangular path in the sky,stopping at the same position, and turning to travel in the opposite transverse direction. The movement was very perfect, as though a designated flight pattern had been precalculated.  The entire sighting lasted for about 8 minutes.  Also, both ufo&apos;s had a soft, yet intense white luminescense. And both ufo&apos;s were initially bright, and it was 4:30 in the afternoon, in bright sunlight on a partly cloudy day.",

The UFO was travelling the exact direction away from me, due South.  It&apos;s magnatude was around 2.0 (about the same magnatude as the stars in Ursa Major).  As the UFO continued south, it&apos;s magnitude diminished.  The UFO was no longer visible at about 20-30 degrees above the horizon.  When I could no longer see the UFO I spotted an aircraft that sounded like a commercial airliner.  The aircraft was travelling at the same speed(from my viewpoint) and parallel to the UFO.  The aircraft was about 5 degrees East of the UFO&apos;s trejectory, and also lagged the UFO anywhere from 40-50 degrees.  Both the aircraft and the UFO travelled in a straight path. At 23 years old, I am an amateur astronomer who has always taken an interest in looking at the stars.  I became extremely dedicated to observing about 2 years ago, which is when I was trialling a nice pair of binoculars to see if I wanted to invest in a telescope.  Currently I own 2 refracting (60mm &amp; 70mm) scopes and 1 reflecting (130mm) telescope.",
